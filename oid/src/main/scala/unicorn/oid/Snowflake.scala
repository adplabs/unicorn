/** 64 bit ID generator based on Twitter Snowflake.
  * An id is composed of:
  *  time - 41 bits (millisecond precision with a custom epoch gives us 69 years)
  *  configured worker id - 10 bits - up to 1024 workers/threads/machines
  *  sequence number - 12 bits - rolls over every 4096 per worker (with protection to avoid rollover in the same ms)
  *
  * You should use NTP to keep your system clock accurate.
  * Snowflake protects from non-monotonic clocks, i.e. clocks
  * that run backwards.  If your clock is running fast and NTP
  * tells it to repeat a few milliseconds, snowflake will refuse
  * to generate ids until a time that is after the last time
  * we generated an id. Even better, run in a mode where NTP
  * won't move the clock backwards.
  *
  * @param worker worker id, which can be given 'by hand' per process, or by ZooKeeper on its startup.
  * @param sequence the start sequence number, increasing in the same ms with protection to avoid rollover
